1. GUI loads a standard 3x3 grid with 9 JButtons and prompt player to select where to play 
2. Player will click on a button in the grid and X will be placed. 
3. Players alternate with X and O being placed. 
4. After turn 5 run isGameOver() each turn to check for a winner.
5. If there is a winner - diplay a pop up to the screen "PlayerX/O wins!" with play again or quit options. 
6. If no winner, swap players and continue.
